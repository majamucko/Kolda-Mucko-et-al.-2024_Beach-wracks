## Abstract: 
Beach wracks consist mainly of seagrasses and seaweeds washed ashore by storms, tides and winds, they protect beach from erosion and serve as an important habitat. However, due to the global anthropogenic impact, beach wracks are currently littered with plastics. This study aimed to investigate beach wrack microbiomes at central Adriatic Sea (CA) and southern Adriatic Sea (SA) on beaches of different types and exposure. Sampling was performed with special focus on microplastic particles and styrofoam incorporated into beach wrack. Bacterial community was determined with V3-V4 variable region 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Plastics were visually examined by Zeiss loupe and qualitatively analyzed using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy which revealed dominant polyethylene (PE) composition of plastic pellets (HDPE 16.1%, LDPE 38.4%, unknown PE 26.8%) and PP (14.3%), with 4.5% undetermined. Seagrass type present in CA stations beach wracks was Cymodocea/Zoostera, while in SA stations was Posidonia oceanica, while sedimentological analysis determined carbonate gravel sediment type.  Detailed analysis of the individual plastispheres showed no statistically significant connection of the assembled community to plastics type. Beta analysis of bacterial community dissimilarity concluded separation of Cymodocea/Zostera vs. Posidonia oceanica wrack vs. seawater control  (robust Aitchison Distance, 94.54% of total community explained, PERMANOVA/ANOSIM p-value=0.001). In Cymodocea/Zostera wracks, the family Cyclobacteriaceae (Bacteroidetes) was dominant, while Posidonia oceanica wracks were defined by the Bacteroidetes genus Arenibacter and Gammaproteobacteria genera Cobetia and Pseudoalteromonas. P. oceanica wracks shared several dominant genera with seawater samples: Vibrio (Gammaproteobacteria) and Planococcaceae (Firmicutes). Putative functional analysis assigned at least one functional group (FG) to 37.88 % of the bacterial community, predominantly for: methylotrophy, methanol oxidation, respiration of sulfur compounds, nitrate/nitrite denitrification and fermentation. Furthermore, many human pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus were detected, as well as bacteria connected to the human gut. Plastic degradation taxa was recorded, e.g. Varovorax paradoxus. To our knowledge, this is a first study considering gravel and artificial beach wracks, providing insights of the influence of anthropogenic debris impacting beach wrack microbiome and subsequently the health of Adriatic Sea beaches.
